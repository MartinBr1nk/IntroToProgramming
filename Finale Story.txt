You Log onto the terminal and send a comm to the elite operations team. They reply almost instantaneously saying that you need to give them the authorisation code which is on your system. The code is 3950 which you message to them faster than a cheetah running after its prey. Sitting in your cubicle you then hear a loud clang echo against the stairwell. the sound reverberates along the entire bunker you have been stuck in. You feel a wave of relief clear your head and you exhale heavily. You then go into the main corridor where you see many people in SWAT-like outfits rush the corridor with guns pointed at you. Yelling "GET DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW", they point the guns with flashlights at you blinding you. "I am the one who called you!", you say, however it does not seem that they care. It seems that this was a stickup and you were to die no matter what you do. Well, goodbye dear player. I hope you enjoyed this experience. Maybe give it one more go? y'know, get the other endings, (I'm not supposed to tell you that there are more endings but you seem cool)

Thank you and Goodbye.
